# US Government Rule and Regulation Explorer

This is a little web app to help navigate the rules, regulations, and comments for the US Government using the regulations.gov API.

**This site and code have no connection to the U.S. Government!**

## Why did you build this?

In late 2020, the General Services Administration (GSA) released a new version of "regulations.gov" - the U.S. Government's website for publishing agency rulemaking dockets and documents - to replace the aging, Flash-based version. That site is intended to give citizens transparency into the agency rule making process. It allows people to look at proposed rule changes and the comments on them. A person can even submit comments on those documents.

Unfortunately, this new version was not quite ready for prime time and lacked key features and data organization that had enabled organizations to act on that transparency. This application was created using the new API provided by GSA and Data.gov into the regulations.gov data. That API still has many faults, but it allows this application to provide a better user experience.
